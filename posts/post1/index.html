        <h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>Hello! This is my first post. I'm really not sure what to write here honestly. I guess I'll just talk about this project and my experience up to this point in time.</p>
<p>Modern web development is pretty wild. The amount of tools to learn just doesn't end. So far, I've mostly been implementing Eleventy along with some sqlite3 features. I would really like to delve into react, and by extension vite, but my brain is just so fried. I need to step back so I don't burn out and lose interest.</p>
<p>Having a project like this is actually invaluable for learning. All you have to do is never start over. Don't make a new project. Just work on the same project for a long time, and implement any new tools you learn. It gives you reason to use them, you get to see these tools work in a practical scenario, and it adds to your dev portfolio.</p>
<p>As your project grows you will learn how to structure it properly. You will learn why certain naming conventions and file structures are standard, you will learn when to stick these conventions, and when you can structure things your own way. You'll learn when to follow the &quot;rules&quot; - and also when to break them. I think everybody should have a project like this.</p>
<p>Your website is your infinite canvas.</p>
