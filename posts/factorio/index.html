      <h1>Factorio is Addicting</h1>
<h3>I just can't with this game.</h3>
<p>Why did I start playing this game? I can't STOP. There's always something to that needs to be done, something that needs to be more efficient, resources I'm running low on. You think to yourself &quot;Just 30 more minutes, I'll complete everything I need for the day&quot; - NOPE. Your factory is still inefficient. It needs to be improved, always. The factory must grow.</p>
<p>Once I started understanding robots, it was over. Robots take away so many frustrations experienced in the early stages of the game.</p>
