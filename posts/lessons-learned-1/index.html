        <h1>Learned some interesting stuff today</h1>
<h3>I better write it down before I forget</h3>
<p>Well, it's currently 12:05 AM, I really shouldn't be up this late, but I can't help it. When there's a problem, it's gotta be fixed. I converted my js files to typescript, I can see the benefit of using typescript now.</p>
<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>When export and importing modules, there's two different ways. a regular export, and a default export.</p>
<p>When importing a module's default export, I'm allowed to call it whatever I want. However, if importing any other export, it must be the same name. Gotta keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Also, I need to make sure im not calling any functions in my modules. Whenever I import a module, it'll call any functions that the module itself calls. That was a headache.</p>
<h3>Dreaded links</h3>
<p><code>My goodness, I can't stand working with links. They might need to be relative, they might need to be absolute, I might need to accomodate for the site url, ugh. It's frustrating. Actually, it wouldn't be so bad, if I wasn't having to work in eleventy's url prefix. Since i'm using github pages, I need to be able to include the prefix on my site. Learned a couple neat things along the way. </code></p>
<p><code>First of all, I can set a global variable in eleventy's config - eleventyConfig.addGlobalData(&quot;ELEVENTY_BASE&quot;, prefix);</code>
<code>This let me pass along the prefix into my html file (and potentially, any other data I could ever want) &lt;script&gt; window.ELEVENTY_BASE = &quot;{ ELEVENTY_BASE | safe }&quot;; &lt;script&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>You can then actually pass this sata to a global variable in the html file with window.VARIABLE name, which can me picked up in my main.js file. So now we have a good flow going. eleventy --&gt; html --&gt; js</code></p>
<h3>Other random little discoveries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting a ! at the end of a declaration tells typescript that a variable will exist for sure.</li>
<li>A script has to have type=&quot;module&quot; for vite to detect it</li>
<li>I need to commit to memory certain Git features. in the unix editor, INS to type, ESC to unfocus, :wq to write &amp; quit. Hard to remember sometimes</li>
<li>I can make eleventy ignore posts... wait maybe I don't want to do that.</li>
<li>Always keep in mind the order in which scripts run. Even with more experience, I'm still prone to this. If the script interacts with the DOM and the DOM isn't fully loaded yet, it won't be able to actually do anything. I can use document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;,()=&gt;{}) if for whatever reason I want the script on top, but need the DOM loaded first. Good for keeping things organized I guess.</li>
<li>There's probably a lot more but im dead tired and need to go to bed.</li>
