      <h1>Learned some interesting stuff today</h1>
<h3>I better write it down before I forget</h3>
<p>Well, it's currently 12:05 AM, I really shouldn't be up this late, but I can't help it. When there's a problem, it's gotta be fixed. I converted my js files to typescript, I can see the benefit of using typescript now.</p>
<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>When export and importing modules, there's two different ways. a regular export, and a default export.</p>
<p>When importing a module's default export, I'm allowed to call it whatever I want. However, if importing any other export, it must be the same name. Gotta keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Also, I need to make sure im not calling any functions in my modules. Whenever I import a module, it'll call any functions that the module itself calls. That was a headache.</p>
<h3>Dreaded links</h3>
<p><code>My goodness, I can't stand working with links. They might need to be relative, they might need to be absolute, I might need to accomodate for the site url, ugh. It's frustrating. Actually, it wouldn't be so bad, if I wasn't having to work in eleventy's url prefix. Since i'm using github pages, I need to be able to include the prefix on my site. Learned a couple neat things along the way. </code></p>
<p><code>First of all, I can set a global variable in eleventy's config - eleventyConfig.addGlobalData(&quot;ELEVENTY_BASE&quot;, prefix);</code>
<code>This let me pass along the prefix into my html file (and potentially, any other data I could ever want) &lt;script&gt; window.ELEVENTY_BASE = &quot;{ ELEVENTY_BASE | safe }&quot;; &lt;script&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>You can then actually pass this sata to a global variable in the html file with window.VARIABLE name, which can me picked up in my main.js file. So now we have a good flow going. eleventy --&gt; html --&gt; js</code></p>
<h3>Other random little discoveries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting a ! at the end of a declaration tells typescript that a variable will exist for sure.</li>
<li>A script has to have type=&quot;module&quot; for vite to detect it</li>
<li>I need to commit to memory certain Git features. in the unix editor, INS to type, ESC to unfocus, :wq to write &amp; quit. Hard to remember sometimes</li>
<li>I can make eleventy ignore posts... wait maybe I don't want to do that.</li>
<li>There's probably a lot more but im dead tired and need to go to bed.</li>
</ul>
