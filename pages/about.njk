<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Oliver Flatt, and I live in San Antonio, Texas. I'm self-employed and I live simply, 
    primarily working as an IT Technician, but also taking on various side-hustles, blue collar work, artistic projects, and other random things.
</p>

<p>Driven by curiosity and a desire to chase novelty, I'm constantly challenging myself, pushing my limitations. I thrive on taking on new things.
    Sometimes I like to do things "the hard way" in order to prove whats possible. Taking on things "the hard way"
    often teaches you more than that the easy route would have, enabling one to be far more versatile in any given task.
